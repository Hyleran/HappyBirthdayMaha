                        <div class="message-content">
                            <p>To my wonderful friend Maha,</p>

                            <p>It's your birthday. When I started making this, I was just thinking about all the fun and how much I wanted to celebrate you. And I still do, so much.</p>

                            <p>But I've also been thinking about what birthdays really are. They're more than just a party; they're this weird, vulnerable checkpoint where you look back, look forward, and feel everything all at once. They can hold secret disappointments right next to your biggest hopes. And I know this past year hasn't been the easiest lap around the sun for you.</p>

                            <p>I know things have felt heavy lately—with family, with school, with your own mind feeling like a tough place to be. I want you to know, more than anything, that I see that. I see how hard you're working, even on the days when just getting through feels like a monumental task. I see your strength, even when you might not feel strong.</p>

                            <p>On a day that's supposed to be all joy, it's okay if your feelings are more complicated. <strong>It is completely okay to not be okay on your birthday.</strong> You don't have to perform happiness. My wish for you today isn't for a forced smile, but for moments of real peace. For the comfort of knowing you are deeply loved exactly as you are in this moment—overwhelmed, resilient, and perfectly human.</p>

                            <p>Looking at our timeline, I realize our whole friendship is a story of getting through things. We started talking in February, navigated friend group changes in September, had those late-night calls where we figured stuff out, and realized we were getting closer in October. We've been building something real through all of it. You've always been the friend who makes ordinary moments feel important, and you have this quiet way of making people feel seen.</p>

                            <p>So today, I'm turning the spotlight on you. Not to pressure you, but to remind you: <strong>You are not your struggles.</strong> You are the person who debates brilliantly at MUN sessions. You are the one who shows up, who laughs until it hurts, who is loyal in the most incredible way. The world is genuinely better because you're in it.</p>

                            <p>My birthday wish for you this year is simple and huge: <strong>I wish you relief.</strong> I wish for the crushing weight to lighten. I wish for you to find pockets of calm and reasons for hope that feel true. I wish for your coming year to have more gentle days, small victories, and the deep, comforting knowledge that you have people in your corner—and I am so firmly, permanently in your corner.</p>

                            <p>I am here for the 10% wholesome celebrations and the 90% real, unvarnished, challenging, beautiful life. I'm here for the meltdowns and the memes. I'm here, always.</p>

                            <p>Thank you for trusting me with your stories. Thank you for being my friend. I am so proud of you, and I'm so excited to see you heal and grow this year.</p>

                            <p>All my love,<br>
                            Your friend, always ❤️</p>
